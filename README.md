# learning-zig

I am a web developer. I mostly work with html, css, and js. I used to write C programs about 6 years ago. It is always interesting for me to learn a new language. Recently, I decided to learn a new programming language alongside my law studies and part-time programming. I was struggling to choose the right programming language.

I am not seeking a language with high demand in the market. I just want to learn something which is fast. That is why I have chosen to learn Zig.

This repo will be used as my notebook for learning the Zig language. There are not enough Zig learning resources online. I do not know if this will even help anyone or not, but I will just write my thoughts and what I struggled with in the Zig language.
