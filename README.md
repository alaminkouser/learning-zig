# learning-zig

I am a web developer. I mostly work with `html`, `css` and `js`. I used to write `c` programme about 6 years ago. It is always interesting to learn new language to me. Recently I decided to learn a new programming language besides by law studies and part time programming. I was struggling to choosing the right programming language.

I am not looking to find a job which a good market demand or a job market. I just want to learn something which is fast. That is why I have choosen to learn zig.

This repo will be used as my note book of me learning the zig language. There is not enough zig learning resources online. I do not know if this wil even help anyone or not, but I will just write my thoughts and what I struggeled with in the zig language.
